# Simple-Quiz-App
This is a simple quiz app which allows users to answer quizzes with four options and only one correct answer. I worked on this project to learn more about developing games/ game-like apps so that I have a proper foundation to work on a bigger project like EduExcel (An online quiz platform). I was able to develop this project with the help of a YouTube channel 'How to Become a Developer'. At the moment I am working on the following updates to the existing code:
1. Adding a quiz creation section with a form to input quiz title, questions, answers, and correct answer index.
2. Adding styles for the new quiz creation section and input fields.
3. Adding functionality to dynamically add question inputs, save the quiz data, and store it in an array.
